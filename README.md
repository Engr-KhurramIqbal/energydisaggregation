# energydisaggregation
Energy disaggregation is a process of separating electrical signatures of individual appliances from the aggregated load of a house.This process is to be done without using energy meters for individual appliances. Energy disaggregation is helpful in various ways. This process motivates the users to check their energy consumption and to avail the incentives offered by suppliers. This technique can trace the event, the type of appliance and the fault in the system. Energy disaggregation is useful both for the user and the supplier as well as it is equally beneficial at the national and international levels to reduce energy consumption. The detailed consumption data enables the user to understand the consumption behavior. The technique is capable of identifying the widely used household appliances which ultimately reduce the electricity bill. The study of energy disaggregation suggests the pattern of using appliances in a very economical way and covers all the aspects of cost-saving up to 5-15.Energy disaggregation can be done by the analysis of the measurement of a single point of current and voltage of the aggregated load obtained from the meter placed outside the residence. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) consists of four elementary steps i.e. signal measurement, event detection, characteristic extraction, and energy disaggregation.
